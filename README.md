WEEK 4 DELIVERABLES - VERSION CONTROL (Git & Github)

Version control or source control is basically a system of tracking and managing changes to a software code
especially when there are more people working on the code. Version control helps software teams work faster.
It enables everyone working on a sotware to be up to date with the newest version of changes made to the code.

While there are different types of version control system out there today, the most common and widely used is GIT. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Thousands of software projects around the world today rely on Git for version control.
The plaform to store projects initialized with Git is Github. It allows programmers and developers to store their projects and periodically
upadte the project overtime.


SOME GIT COMMANDS AND THEIR USEFULNESS
* git init      - this is a one-time command is to setup and initialize a repository for a new project
* git clone     - this command is used to create a working copy of an already initialized repository
* git add       - this command is used to stage changes made to an initialized or cloned repository
* git commit    - this command is used to commit or capture a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes
* git push      - this command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
* git fetch     - this command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
                    it is used when you want to see what everybody else has been working on on the repo.
* git pull      - this command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update
                    the local repository to match that content.
* git branch    - this command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches in git.
* git checkout  - this command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch.
* git merge     - this command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate 
                    them into a single branch.

These are the common git commands used when working with git.
