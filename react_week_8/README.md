For week 8, I created a functional online journal.
I made use of react hook - useState() to take in an input and display that input when the add button is clicked.
The web app was developed with two Button components, an Input component, header, footer and the note card.


I decided to work on this particular project in order to apply the lessons I learnt from the different materials - from reusable components to react hooks. And to also cahllenge my knowledge to create something different from a static landing page.
