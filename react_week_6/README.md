I practiced different terms within this single react app that is why I have different components (I did not delete them so that I can come back to reference them in the future anytime I may need it).

But my deliverables for this week is inside the "Tasks_Components" folder. Which is what will be displayed on the web page.

My task for this week is basically a menu list for a restaurant developed with React.
Each Menu item is a reusable component that has its data stored in a separate Javascript file which is imported as props into the component.
